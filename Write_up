Fresh water is quickly becoming a more limited resource. As such, it is important to monitor and regulate water usage to ensure access to clean drinking water. In this Report I use feature engineering to create a model to predict fresh water levles in Lake Bilancino. 

Feature Engineering Techniques:
- Phase shifting
- Averages
- Datetime Resampling

Statistics:
- Spearmanr

Models used are:

Time series models:
- Simple Average
- Holt's Linear Trend
- Previous Cycle

Linear Models:
- Polynomial Regression
- General Linear Model/TweedieRegression

Seasonal Models:
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
