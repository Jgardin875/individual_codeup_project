    "Water is obviously essential to human life. While most first world countries can simply turn a tap to access fresh clean water, that is not the case for everyone. Also, even first world countires are seeing the effects of climate change on fresh water resources. California in the USA has suffered droughts in recent years. Water levels in Lake Mead in the USA is on a 22 year downward spiral.(1) And this is not just limited to the USA, water supplies are being stressed to capacity globaly. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "As climate change impacts weather patterns, water may become increasingly in short supply.(2) Learning how to predict and effecitvely manage water supplies, especially fresh water supplies, is crucial for city development and human survival. And although most of the Earth's surface is coverd in water, over 97% is saltwater. That leaves less than 3% fit for human consumption, and of that 3% over half is frozen as glaciers or otherwise unavailable. (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, regulating freshwater resources is crucial to the success of thriving cities and growing populations across the globe."

    "By analyzing past patterns in weather, temperature, and more, we can predict quantities of freshwater that may be available in upcoming years. This can help in determining if there needs to be caps on watering lawns, washing cars, etc. in order to ensure that everyone has sufficient drinking water to thrive. "
